RULES----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Nim Game !
The goal of the game is to not take the last match.
You can take every match of a line, but you can't take others.

FEATURES-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can play against a friend in player vs player,
or you can play against the computer.
You also can choose the maximum match value.
You can decide if you can play in the text version or the graphic version.
I advice you to play in the GUI version which is a lot more enjoyable.
You aslo can decide who start first when you play against IA (click in the next button)

HOW TO PLAY----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to play graphical mode type "-gui"
If you want to chose the number of match type for exemple "-match7"
If you wanna play against a friend type "-pvp".

If you choose to not play in the graphical mod :
You can choose the line and the match you wanna take off by typing for exemple
4 2 , this say : Take out 2 matchs from the line number 4
YOu can exit the game by typing "exit".
BECAREFUL THE LINE NUMBER DONT MATCH WITH THE REAL LINE.
For exemple the line four can be the line one in reality.

If you play in the graphical mod , you need to choose the match
you wanna take off by clicking the right side of the match,
and when you finish you need to click the top right button to finish
your round.
Also , you can finish the first round by clicking pass directly if you wanna let the
IA play first.
